# TODO

For now I'm currently:
- Each function used (native or not) is preceded by \ because it's in root namespace

Then,
- Installation script on first run (protected by password?)
- Add hooks to upgrade modding power
- Make core\Logger::log() method take an array if a message has to be logged in two channels (types)
