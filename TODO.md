# TODO

For now I'm currently:
- create better exception system
- use enums
- add PostgreSQL support
- test different documentation system
- maintain

Then,
- add more types to vanilla logs

Note:
- should \core\Base::hydrate emit a warning when nothing is hydrated ? that can lead to unseen errors (for now it doesn't)
